# magicbricks-data-scraper

Here you have a main python script which scraps the data out of the magic bricks website using Beautiful soup.

-> How to use this app.

Simply run the script and input your city name in the first line. 
When the script is completed running it will output the data in an excel sheet of the name of the city.

(Bhopal.xlsx if you searched for the data for the city Bhopal.)

Note:-

If you run the scripts too many time your request might get declined. You can use an online paid client to send requests 
from different IPs.
